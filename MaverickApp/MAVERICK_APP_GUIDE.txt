🎮 MAVERICK TASK APP - QUICK START GUIDE

✅ WHAT'S BEEN CREATED:

1. React Native Expo App (Android-ready)
   - Location: /home/midas/MaverickApp/
   - Built with: Expo, React Native, TypeScript

2. Main Features:
   ✨ Big Orange MAVERICK Button - tap to trigger dubstep sting
   🎵 Dubstep Sting Audio - generated 300ms sound effect  
   📋 40 Pre-loaded Tasks - from assets/tasks.json
   🗑️ Long-Press Delete - hold task for ~1 second to remove
   📊 Task Counter - shows remaining tasks

3. Key Files:
   - /app/index.tsx - Main app component (all logic in one screen)
   - /assets/tasks.json - List of 40 sample tasks
   - /assets/dubstep-sting.wav - Generated audio file (26KB)
   - /package.json - Dependencies (includes expo-av for audio)

📦 TO RUN THE APP:

Option 1 - Using the start script:
  $ cd /home/midas/MaverickApp
  $ ./start.sh

Option 2 - Manual:
  $ cd /home/midas/MaverickApp
  $ npm run android

Option 3 - Development mode:
  $ cd /home/midas/MaverickApp
  $ npm start
  Then press 'a' for Android emulator

🎯 HOW IT WORKS:

1. User taps the MAVERICK button
2. Dubstep sting plays via expo-av Audio module
3. A random task is selected from the 40 tasks
4. Task appears in a card below the button
5. User can read the task
6. Long-press (1+ seconds) on task to delete it
7. Task counter updates
8. Repeat!

🔧 CUSTOMIZATION:

Add more tasks:
  - Edit /assets/tasks.json
  - Add strings to the "tasks" array
  - No restart needed (app reloads on save)

Change the button color:
  - Edit app/index.tsx
  - Find: backgroundColor: '#FF6B35' (orange)
  - Change to any hex color

Change delete time:
  - Edit app/index.tsx
  - Find: setTimeout(..., 1000)
  - Change 1000 to milliseconds (e.g., 500 = half second)

📱 ANDROID REQUIREMENTS:

- Android 6.0+ (API 23+)
- ~150MB for emulator or Expo Go app
- Audio permissions (auto-granted by Expo)

🚀 BUILDING FOR PRODUCTION:

  $ cd /home/midas/MaverickApp
  $ eas build --platform android

📝 NOTES:

- Tasks are deleted only in memory (not persisted to disk)
- App state resets when app is restarted
- To add persistence, would need AsyncStorage or local database
- Audio file is programmatically generated (no external audio needed)
- App uses modern React 19 + Expo 54

✨ READY TO GO!

The app is fully functional and ready to deploy to an Android device or emulator.
